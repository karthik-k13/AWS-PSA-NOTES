🔧 What is DevOps?
##########################################
DevOps is a combination of two words:

Dev = Development (writing code)

Ops = Operations (managing infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring)

👉 DevOps is a culture, set of practices, and tools that aim to:

Bridge the gap between development and operations teams, so software can be built, tested, and released faster, more reliably, and continuously.


🎯 Main Goals of DevOps
#####################################
Faster delivery of software

Automation of processes (build, test, deploy)

Improved collaboration between teams

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)

Higher software quality with fewer bugs

Rapid recovery from failures

🏢 What is IT Infrastructure?
#####################################

IT Infrastructure refers to the basic physical and virtual resources required to run and manage IT services and software applications.

✅ In simple terms:

It's everything you need to host, run, connect, store, protect, and manage your software and data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 Components of IT Infrastructure
################################################

When you're setting up a software company (or any IT service), you need several core resources:

a) 🖥️ Machines (Servers & Computers)
Physical or virtual servers that run applications

Developer/employee laptops, desktops

b) 🌐 Network
Routers, switches, firewalls, internet connections

Ensures all systems can communicate securely and efficiently

c) ⚡ Power
Reliable electricity supply, UPS, generators

Keeps systems running 24/7

d) 💾 Storage
Hard drives, SSDs

Stores your application code, databases, files, and backups

e) 🛡️ Backup
Systems to regularly copy and save important data

Protects from data loss due to failure, attacks, or mistakes

f) 🔐 Security
Firewalls, antivirus, encryption, access controls

Protects systems and data from unauthorized access or cyberattacks

🧠 Summary
All these components together make up the IT Infrastructure – the foundation needed to build and run software services smoothly and securely.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🏢 What is On-Prem Infrastructure?
#################################################
On-Premises (On-Prem) infrastructure means:
-> You buy, own, and manage all your IT resources physically at your location (like office or data center).

🔧 You are responsible for:
a. Buying hardware (servers, routers, storage)

b. Setting up network, power backup

c. Hiring IT staff for maintenance

d. Handling security, repairs, and upgrades

⚠️ Challenges with On-Prem Infrastructure
################################################
💰 High Initial Investment – You have to buy everything upfront (costly!)

👨‍🔧 High Manpower – You need skilled IT people to manage it

📈 Scalability is Hard – Difficult to increase/decrease capacity quickly

🔌 Availability – System failures = downtime

🌐 Network Issues – You manage your own connections

🔐 Security Issues – You are responsible for data protection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


☁️ What is Cloud Computing?
################################
Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources like servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

🔑 Key Idea:
You rent resources from cloud providers when you need them, instead of buying.

✅ Benefits of Cloud Computing

☁️ Cloud Service Models
Cloud providers offer different levels of services depending on how much control and responsibility you want. These models are:

IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

PaaS – Platform as a Service

SaaS – Software as a Service


🧱 What is IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)?
####################################################
-> IaaS is a cloud service model where the cloud provider gives you raw infrastructure, and you build everything on top of it.

🏗️ Think of it like:
"You rent a fully functional empty building, and it’s your job to furnish it, decorate it, and use it however you want."

✅ What the cloud provider gives you:
---------------------------------------------
🖥️ Virtual Machines (VMs)

🌐 Networking (IP, firewall, load balancer)

💾 Storage (hard drives, SSDs)

⚙️ Virtualization, Servers, Data Center

✅ What you (the customer) have to do:
------------------------------------------------
Install Operating System (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows)

Install runtime environments (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.)

Set up web servers (Apache, Nginx, Tomcat, etc.)

Deploy and manage your application code

Handle updates, patches, and security

📦 Example Scenario
----------------------------------
Let’s say you want to host a Java web application.

Using IaaS:
------------
You create a VM on AWS EC2

Install Ubuntu

Install Java, Tomcat, MySQL

Deploy your .war file

Configure your firewall, ports, etc.

🔧 Common IaaS Providers
Provider		Service Example
AWS			EC2, EBS, VPC
Microsoft Azure		Virtual Machines
Google Cloud		Compute Engine
Oracle Cloud		OCI Compute
DigitalOcean		Droplets

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ What is PaaS (Platform as a Service)?
#############################################
PaaS is a cloud service model where the cloud provider gives you a ready-made platform (runtime, OS, web server, etc.) so that you can directly deploy and run your application — without worrying about setting up servers or infrastructure.

🎯 Key Idea:
You focus only on developing and deploying your code, and the cloud provider takes care of the platform and infrastructure underneath.

✅ What the cloud provider gives you:
----------------------------------------
Pre-installed OS

Runtime environment (like Java, Node.js, Python)

Web server (e.g., Apache, Tomcat)

Auto-scaling, load balancing, and patching

Built-in monitoring and logging

✅ What you (the customer) need to do:
----------------------------------------
Write your application code

Upload/deploy your app on the platform

Manage your data, and maybe configure some settings

You don’t need to:

Install OS

Set up web servers

Configure runtime manually

📦 Example Scenario
------------------------
Let’s say you want to deploy a Java Spring Boot application.

Using PaaS:

Choose a PaaS provider like Heroku or Google App Engine

Push your code using Git

The platform automatically:

Sets up the Java environment

Deploys your app

Manages scaling and traffic

You just monitor it and update the code when needed.

☁️ Popular PaaS Providers
Provider				Service Example
Heroku				Easy app deployment (multi-language)
Google App Engine		Run apps without managing servers
AWS Elastic Beanstalk		Deploy web apps in Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
Microsoft Azure App Service	Deploy and scale web apps easily

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 What is SaaS (Software as a Service)?
####################################################
SaaS is a cloud service model where the cloud provider gives you ready-to-use software, and you can access it through the internet — no installation, no setup, no servers.

🎯 Key Idea:
You simply use the software; everything else — like servers, updates, backups, and security — is managed by the cloud provider.

✅ What the cloud provider handles:
------------------------------------------
Application software

Servers and infrastructure

Updates and bug fixes

Data storage and backup

Security and availability

✅ What you (the customer) do:
--------------------------------------------
Just log in to the app (usually in a browser)

Use it to manage your tasks, documents, communication, etc.

Pay monthly/yearly (subscription)

📌 No need to install, manage, or update anything.

📦 Example SaaS Applications
App					Purpose
Zoom				Video meetings and communication
Google Drive / Docs		File storage, editing, collaboration
Dropbox	Cloud 			storage
Microsoft 365 (Teams, Word)	Productivity & collaboration
Jira				Project management & issue tracking
Salesforce			Customer relationship management (CRM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

☁️ Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - AWS Service
##############################################################
EC2 is one of the most demanded services in AWS. It allows you to create virtual machines (VMs) in the AWS cloud, which are called EC2 instances.

✅ Key Points about EC2:
-----------------------------------------
What is an EC2 Instance?
-------------------------------------------------
EC2 Instance = Virtual Machine (VM) or Server (you can think of it as a computer that runs on the cloud).

It’s resizable, meaning you can change the configuration of your EC2 instance (e.g., CPU, RAM) based on the demand (if your workload increases, you can scale up).

Billing:
--------------------------------------------
Hourly billing: You pay for the time your EC2 instance runs, by the hour.

Minimum billing period is 1 hour. Even if you use it for less than 1 hour, you'll be billed for a full hour.

Example: If you run your EC2 instance for 15 minutes, you'll still be billed for 1 hour.

Note: AWS offers free tier access for beginners, like the t2.micro/t3.micro instance, which allows 750 hours per month for one year.

Storage:
--------------------------------------------------
EBS (Elastic Block Storage) is used to store data for EC2 instances.

Windows EC2 instances come with a default storage of 30 GB.

Linux EC2 instances come with a default storage of 8 GB.

Maximum EBS volume size is 16 TB (16,000 GB).

Networking:
-----------------------------------------------------------
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) service is used to manage the network for EC2 instances.

VPC helps you define private networks and security controls for your EC2 instances.

Creating EC2 Instances:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
To create an EC2 instance, you use an AMI (Amazon Machine Image).

AMI is a pre-configured template that contains the operating system and software required for your EC2 instance.

Examples of AMIs:

Windows AMI

Amazon Linux AMI

Ubuntu AMI

Red Hat AMI

Security:
----------------------------------------------
To secure your EC2 instance, you use Key-Pairs:

Key Pair is a set of public and private keys used for SSH (Secure Shell) login.

One Key Pair can be used for multiple EC2 instances.

For controlling access to your EC2 instance (allowing or restricting traffic), you use Security Groups.

Security Groups act like firewalls to define which incoming and outgoing traffic is allowed.

One Security Group can be assigned to multiple EC2 instances.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating Windows ec2 instance and connecting with it
###########################################################################
1) Create Key Pair (.pem file)
A Key Pair is used for secure login into your EC2 instance.

Public Key: This stays with AWS. It is embedded into the EC2 instance during launch.

Private Key (.pem): You download this. Keep it safe — you’ll need it to access the instance.

🔐 If you lose the .pem file, you cannot connect to your instance unless you've already added another user or created a new key pair and updated it manually.

2) Create Security Group and update Inbound Rules to allow traffic
A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance. You must allow necessary traffic by adding inbound rules:

Protocol	Port	Purpose
RDP	3389	For Windows GUI access
SSH	22	For Linux terminal access
HTTP	80	For web traffic
HTTPS	443	For secure web traffic
MySQL	3306	For database connections
🔒 Best practice: Restrict access by IP instead of using 0.0.0.0/0 (which means open to all).

3) Create EC2 Instance
Steps to launch your instance:

✅ Select AMI: Choose Windows AMI if you want a GUI (e.g., Windows Server 2019).

✅ Select Instance Type: Example — t2.micro (eligible for free tier).

✅ Select Key Pair: Choose the one you created in Step 1.

✅ Select Security Group: Use the one created in Step 2.

✅ Configure Storage: Add/modify EBS Volume (root disk size, additional volumes if needed).

✅ Launch Instance: Review and click Launch.

4) Connect to EC2 instance using RDP client
Once your Windows instance is running:

➤ Steps to Connect via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):
Go to EC2 Console → Instances → Select your instance.

Click on Connect → RDP Client tab.

Download the Remote Desktop File (.rdp).

Click Get Password → Upload your .pem file to decrypt the password.

Open the .rdp file → Enter the username (usually Administrator) and decrypted password.

Accept the certificate warning → You’ll be logged into your Windows EC2 instance.
